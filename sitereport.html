    <h2>Site Report</h2>
    <!--body-->
    <p>In this project I have used a multi-page website in HTML and CSS. The website includes five pages: Home, Project, Contact, Video Demo, and Site Report. The website was designed with HTML elements to make the structure clear, logical, and easy to access. The entire style has been managed by a single stylesheet (new.css) which ensure the layout, colour scheme, and typography remain the same in all pages. The major aspects of the website are responsive navigation bar, a working contact form and organized project.</p>
    <!--over all experience-->
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>The website helped me gain good experience on front-web development. This project made me understand the CSS Box Model and layouts with Flexbox, especially the layout of the navigation menu and the home page. The project also helped to manage the file organisation and proper management of path when connecting several HTML pages and media files.</p>
    <!--design decision-->
    <h3>Why This Design</h3>
    <p>Because I think minimalist design attract people and I have used dark colour in header and footer which perfectly aliens with light colour content field to provide a high contrast and readable texture. I have put uniform navigation system so that users can find information in easy way.</p>
